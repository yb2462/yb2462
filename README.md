### Hello everyine!ðŸ‘‹

I am a recent graduate from Columbia University with a B.A. in Computer Science and minor in Math where I focused on Intelligent Systems. I am currently working at @A2R-lab on an optimization solver for LQR problems in Robotics (you can see some of my work here https://github.com/A2R-Lab/Block-Factorization and https://github.com/A2R-Lab/GLASS). I am also interested in Computer Vision and other AI applications. I look forward to doing more research on how to improve different intelligence systems and find ways to apply my knowledge of Math and Comp-Sci to real world problems. Don't hesitate to reach out with any ideas or projects!
